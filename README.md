Chingu Roundtable - All About Refactoring code examples

## Introduction

This project was created to contain examples to support the Chingu Roundtable
presentation - "All About Refactoring".

As such the code in these files aren't real applications or intended to be
functional. Instead, they provide us with a way to demonstrate common problems
that can be solved through code refactoring.

## How to use

Scripts have been created in the `package.json` configuration file to allow
the different example files to be run. These are

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| enhancement | Run the enhancement example (`npm run enhancement`) |
| readability | Run the readability example (`npm run readability`) |
| techdebt    | Run the technical debt example (`npm run techdebt`) |
